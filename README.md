# 🏥 Healthcare Claims Optimization & Patient Segmentation

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes simulated US healthcare claims data to identify high-cost patients, segment users based on diagnosis and utilization, and forecast future claim trends. It blends Excel, SQL, and Python to deliver actionable insights and dashboards.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Excel (EDA, dashboarding)
- SQL (schema design, queries)
- Python (RFM segmentation, anomaly detection, forecasting)

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Raw claims data in Excel
- `sql/`: Database schema and queries
- `python/`: Analytical scripts
- `dashboard/`: Final Excel dashboard

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Load `claims_data.xlsx` into Excel for initial EDA
2. Use `claims_schema.sql` to create tables in MySQL/PostgreSQL
3. Run Python scripts for segmentation and forecasting
4. Explore insights in `dashboard.xlsx`
